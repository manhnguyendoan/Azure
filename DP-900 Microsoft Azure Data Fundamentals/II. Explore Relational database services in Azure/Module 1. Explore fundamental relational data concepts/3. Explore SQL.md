> SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and is used to communicate with a relational database.

## SQL statement types
  - Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - Data Control Language (DCL)
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Create, modify, and remove tables and other objects in a database (table, stored procedures, views, and so on).
- The most common DDL statements: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME.
- Example:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Product
(
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL NULL
);
```

### DCL statements
- Database administrators generally use DCL statements to manage access to objects in a database by granting, denying, or revoking permissions to specific users or groups.
- Three main DCL statements are: GRANT, DENY, REVOKE.
- Example:
```SQL
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
ON Product
TO user1;
```

### DML statements
- DML statements to manipulate the rows in tables. These statements enable you to retrieve (query) data, insert new rows, or modify existing rows. You can also delete rows if you don't need them anymore.
- The four main DML statements are: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
