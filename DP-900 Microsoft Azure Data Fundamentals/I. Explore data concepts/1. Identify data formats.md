# Identify data formats
> Data is a collection of facts such as numbers, descriptions, and observations used to record information.
>
> Classify data as *structured, semi-structured, or unstructured*.

## Structured data
- *Structured data* is data that adheres to a fixed schema, so all of the data has the same fields or properties.
- The data is represented in one or more tables that consist of rows to represent each instance of a data entity, and columns to represent attributes of the entity.

## Semi-structured data
- *Semi-structured* data is information that has some structure, but which allows for some variation between entity instances.
- One common format for semi-structured data is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
- For example, while most customers may have an email address, some might have multiple email addresses, and some might have none at all.

## Unstructured data
- Not all data is structured or even semi-structured. For example, documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files might not have a specific structure. This kind of data is referred to as *unstructured data*.

## Data stores
- The stored data can then be retrieved for analysis and reporting later.
- There are two broad categories of data store in common use:
  - File stores
  - Databases
