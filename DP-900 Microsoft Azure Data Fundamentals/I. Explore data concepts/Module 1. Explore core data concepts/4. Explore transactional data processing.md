# Explore transactional data processing

> Think of a transaction as a small, discrete, unit of work.

## OLTP solutions
- OLTP systems enforce transactions that support so-called ACID semantics:
  - **Atomicity** – each transaction is treated as a single unit, which succeeds completely or fails completely. 
  - **Consistency** – transactions can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another. 
  - **Isolation** – concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state. 
  - **Durability** – when a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed.
